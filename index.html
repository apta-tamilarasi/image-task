			<h2><u>beautiful story of radha krishna</u></h2>
			<p>	
			Krishna returns to Dwaraka. Pradyumna returns to Dwaraka and marries Rukmavati, and a son Aniruddha is born to them.
			To Jambavati and Krishna, a son Samba is born, who is termed to be the reason for the Yadava destruction as cursed by Gandhari. Samba grows up to be short-tempered but loves his family, especially his mother; however, he hates Radha. Later, Samba, Aniruddha, and Balaram's sons Nishath and Ulmuk are sent to Gurukula along with Radha and return after a few years, as teens. Aniruddha is kept in captivity at Shonitapura, the kingdom of Banasura, by his daughter Usha. This soon results in a war between Krishna and Banasura, wherein Shiva has to fight for Banasura due to his boon, resulting in a faceoff between Krishna and Shiva. Krishna defeats Shiva and punishes Banasura for kidnapping his grandson. Soon, Aniruddha is married to Usha while Samba is married to Hastinapur's Kaurava princess, Lakshmanaa, Duryodhana and Bhanumati's daughter. As Samba had previously joined hands with Banasura, he is cursed with leprosy by Krishna and Radha cures him using Mahamrityunjay Jaap. 
			Later, Krishna marries Devi Yamuna.Shankhchuda (rebirth of Sridama) enters the story and has a loving wife, Tulasi, who is his strength but he only uses her. With the help of Tulasi and her devotion to him, Shankhchuda got immense strength and he vows to destroy the whole universe. Krishna disguises himself as Shankhchuda and goes to Tulasi to break her devotion. After Shankhchuda is killed, Tulasi feels cheated. She curses Krishna to become a stone (sālagrāma). However, Tulasi realizes her mistake after she remembers her past. She decides to take her curse back and transforms herself into a Tulasi plant. She then marries Krishna in this form and is told to remain on earth in that form. This displays Tulasi Kalyāna (Tulsi's wedding). Consequently, Hanuman visits Dwarka and witnesses Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita in Krishna, Balarama, and Radha respectively. He gets to know that Krishna and Radha were Rama and Sita in their previous birth and they in turn, are none other than Vishnu and Lakshmi.

			Butterflies (Rhopalocera) are insects that have large, often brightly coloured wings, and a conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the superfamilies Hedyloidea (moth-butterflies in the Americas) and Papilionoidea. Butterfly fossils date to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago.
			Butterflies have a four-stage life cycle, as like most insects they undergo complete metamorphosis. Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae, known as caterpillars, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their entire life cycle.
			Butterflies are often polymorphic, and many species make use of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism to evade their predators. Some, like the monarch and the painted lady, migrate over long distances. Many butterflies are attacked by parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies (e.g., harvesters) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of ants, while others live as mutualists in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts. The Smithsonian Institution says "butterflies are certainly one of the most appealing creatures in nature"
